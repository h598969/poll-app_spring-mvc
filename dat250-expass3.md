****DAT250 Assignment 3****
During this experiment I learnt a lot more of how to use the useEffect and useState hooks in React.
I also learnt how much of a headache it can be to work with CORS. Like, making the backend and frontend communicate properly with CORS was such a pain.

I did not really have any problems creating the frontend, but the only problems I encountered were getting the frontend and backend to communicate.
I managed to make it work eventually, but it took a lot of time.

Also, I spent no time on the styling, because I did not think it was important for the assignment.
