****DAT250 Assignment 2****

I have to be honest and say that I am not good at writing down and explaining what I have done and how it went, but I'll try my best.

I can first of all say that I used the start.spring.io site to create the initial project.
I then created a simple GetMapping to test that it worked like it should, which it did.

I then started setting up the project according to the specified Domain Model, creating the appropriate classes with their respective relations.

After completing that part I created a test scenario by creating a TestScenario.http file. I had to figure out how to write those tests as I went along.
The test didn't immediately pass, so I had to alter some of the classes to work properly. There were some mistakes I had made at first that I later realized were pretty obious mistakes.
When I fixed those mistakes, the http test scenario worked.

For the last part I created the controllers, which all in all went pretty smooth.
